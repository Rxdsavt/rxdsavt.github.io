    <div class="text-justify">
      <p class="font-mono mb-6 text-2xl">
        My name is Shahran Kurnia Ramadhan and I am an aspiring game designer and game writer. I am currently studying Computer Science in Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono mb-6 text-2xl">
        As a beginner game designer, I am eager to learn and grow in this field. I have a strong foundation in design principles and am capable of working with software like Unity to create basic prototypes and concepts. However, I understand that there is always more to learn and am committed to continuing my education and expanding my skills. 
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono mb-6 text-2xl">
      As a beginner writer, I have a strong passion for crafting intricate and detailed worlds, and love to explore the lore and history that give these places depth and personality. While world building is my main focus, I am also capable at crafting engaging narration and dynamic dialogue that help bring stories to life. 
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono mb-6 text-2xl">  
      I am capable of basic visual art work in the form of pixel art and user interface. I understand how to use software such as Aseprite, Inkscape, and Clip Studio Paint to create simple character pixel art, pixel tileset, as well as UI element. I am also capable of implementing such asset in Unity. 
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono mb-24 text-2xl">  
      Feel free to contact me through my email or Discord for any inquiries, I am currently open for work to any type of game or fictional writing related project.
